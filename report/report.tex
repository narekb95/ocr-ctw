\begin{abstract}
    In this article, we describe `HALG2PACE', a solver for the one-sided crossing minimization problem on graphs given together with a low-cutwidth linear arrangement. 
    This solver was developed as part of the PACE challenge 2024 - parameterized track. The solver is based on a dynamic programming scheme over the given linear arrangement, and admits FPT running time with single-exponential dependence on the cutwidth of the given linear arrangement. The solver is implemented in C++ and meets the requirements presented by PACE challenge. The solver was submitted on optil.io under the user name `narekb95' and is available on github at \url{https://github.com/narekb95/ocr-ctw}

\section{Preliminaries}
For $n\in \mathbb{N}$, we denote by $[n]$ the set $\{1,\dots,n\}$.
A \emph{Permutation} $\pi$ of a set $S$ is a bijective mapping from $S$ to $[|S|]$. For $i\in[|S|]$ we denote by $\pi_i$ the element $\pi^-1(i)$ of $S$. Each permutation $\pi$ of a set corresponds (bijectively) to a linear ordering $\leq_{\pi}$, where for $u,v\in s$ it holds that $u\leq_{\pi} v$ if $\pi(u)\leq \pi(v)$. We will use these two terms interchangeably. In particular, we will call $\pi$ an ordering, when we mean the ordering $\leq_{\pi}$ underlying the permutation $\pi$.

A two-layered drawing of a bipartite graph $G=(A,B,E)$ is a drawing that maps its vertices into two different horizontal lines, such that the vertices of $V^1$ are mapped to one line, and the vertices of $V^2$ are mapped to the other. Edges are drawn as straight-line segments between the points corresponding to their endpoints. A two-layered is given as a mapping $\mu\colon V\rightarrow \mathbb{N}^2$. Implicitly, $\mu$ maps each edge $\{u,v\} \in E$ to the line segment between $\mu(u)$ and $\mu(v)$.
For $i\in[2]$, $V^1$, given an ordering $\pi$ over $V_i$, a two-layered drawing of $G$ respects $\pi$ if the order of the points corresponding to the images of the vertices of $V_i$ on the underlying horizontal line matches the order of the vertices themselves given by $\pi$.

In a two-layered drawing $\mu$, and for two edges $e_1, e_2 \in E$, we say that $e_1$ and $e_2$ cross in $\mu$, if $\mu(e_1)$ and $\mu{e_2}$ intersect in a point that is not an endpoint of either line segments. The \emph{number of crossings} of $\mu$ is the number of unordered pairs of edges $\{e_1, e_2\}\in \binom{E}{2}$ such that $e_1$ and $e_2$ cross in $\mu$.
The following observations are Folklore. We refer to \cite{DBLP:journals/algorithmica/DujmovicW04} for more information.
\begin{lemma}
    Given a bipartite graph $G=(V^1,V^2, E)$, together with two orderings $\pi_1, \pi_2$ over $V^1$ and $V^2$ respectively, the number of crossings of any two-layered drawing  of $G$ that respects $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ is invariant of the drawing itself, and determined solely by $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$.
    We call this number of crossings of any such map as the \emph{crossings number of $(\pi_1, pi_2)$}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}
    The \emph{one-sided crossing minimization problem} is defined as follows: Given a bipartite graph $G = (V^1,V^2,E)$ together with a fixed ordering $\pi_1$ over $V^1$, asked is a permutation $\pi_2$ over $V^2$ that minimizes the crossing number of $(\pi_1, \pi_2)$.
\end{definition}

A linear arrangement of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is linear ordering $\ell = v_1\leq \dots \leq v_n$ over the vertices of the graph. Let $V_i = \{v_1,\dots v_i\}$. For $v_i \in V$, we define the cut of $\ell$ at $v_i$ as the set of edges having one endpoint in $V_i$ and the other in $V\setminus V_i$, and call it the $i$th cut of $\ell$. The cut-graph $H_i = (L_i,R_i, E_i)$ is given by the edges of the $i$th cut together with their endpoints, where $L_i\subseteq V_i$ are the endpoints in $V_i$, and $R_i \subseteq V\setminus V_i$ are the other endpoints.


\section{The algorithm}
Finally, we introduce some notation for our algorithm. Along this work, we assume $G=(V^1,V^2, E)$ is the input graph, and $\ell$ a linear arrangement of $G$. Let $k$ be the largest size of a cut of $\ell$. Let $n = |V|$ and $m=|E|$.
Let $\pi_1$ be the give fixed ordering over $V^1$, and $\pi_2$ be the asked ordering.
Finally, for two different vertices $v_1, v_2 \in V^2$, we define $c(v_1,v_2)$ as
\[c(v_1,v_2) = |\{(w_2, w_1)\in N(v_2)\times N(v_1)\colon w_2 <_{\pi_1} w_1\}|.\] 
For two disjoint sets of vertices $X,X'\subseteq V_2$, we define
\[c(X,X') = \sum\limits_{(v_1,v_2)\in X\times X'}c(v_1,v_2).\]
Moreover, for a set $X\subseteq V^2$ we define $c(X)$ as the minimum crossing number of $(\pi_1, \pi')$ of $G[V_1, X]$ over all orderings $\pi'$ of $X$.

\begin{algorithm}\label{alg:subroutine}
    We start a subroutine to compute $c(X)$ for a small set $X$ in time $2^n\operatorname{poly}(n)$. The algorithm follows a similar approach to the well-known dynamic programming algorithm for the Hamiltonian Cycle given by Held and Karp \cite{DBLP:conf/acm/HeldK61} and independently by Bellman \cite{bellman1958combinatorial}. The subroutine iterates over all subsets of $X$ in increasing order (given by the subset relation), and computes an optimal ordering induced by each subset, by the recusive formula
    \[c(X) = min\{c(X\setminus\{v\}) + c(X\setminus \{v\}, v)\colon v \in X\}./\]    
\end{algorithm}

\begin{definition}
    Given a bipartite graph $G= (V_1, V_2, E)$ together with a permutation $\pi_1$ over $V_1$, a pair of vertices $(v_1,v_2)\in V_2^2$ is called suited (in respect to $\pi_1$), if $w_1\leq_{pi_1}w_2$ for each $w_1\in N_G(v_1)$ and $w_2\in N_G(v_2)$.
\end{definition}
We call a pair of vertices $v_1, v_2$ suited, if $c(v_1,v_2)\cdot c(v_2,v_1) = 0$.
Our algorithm is based on the following lemma:
\begin{lemma}[{{\cite[Fact 5]{DBLP:journals/algorithmica/DujmovicW04}}}]
    Let $u,v \in V^2$ be two suited vertices. In any optimal solution $\pi_2$, it holds that if $u\leq_{\pi_2} v$ then $c(u,v) = 0$.
\end{lemma}
Our algorithm follows a dynamic programming approach over the cuts of the linear arrangement $\ell$.
For $i\in[n]$, we define the set $S_i = V^2 \cap V(H_i)$ as the set of vertices of $V^2$ that are incident to edges of the $i$th cut.
The dynamic programming tables are indexed by subsets of $S_i$.
Formally, for $i\in [n]$ let $\mathcal{S}_i = \mathcal{P}(S_i)$ the power-set of $S_i$. we define the dynamic programming tables as vectors $T_i \in \mathbb{N}^{\mathcal{S}_i}$, where for $X\subseteq S_i$ we define $T_i[X]$ as follows:
\[T_i[X] = c(V_i\cup X) + c(V_i, V\setminus (V_i\cup X)).\]

At each cut $i$ our algorithm proceeds as follows: 
Let $S'_i = S_{i-1} \cup S_i$, and $F = S_{i-1} \setminus S_{i}$. We call $F_i$ the set of forget vertices at the $i$th cut. The algorithm first computes both $S'$ and $F$. Then for each subset $X' \subseteq S'_i$ that is a super set of $X' \supseteq F_i$, let $X = X'\setminus F_i$. The algorithm computes $T_{i}[X]$ as
\[T_i[X] = c_1 + c2 + c3\],
where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $c_1 = T_{i-1}(X'\cap S_{i-1})$,
    \item $c_2 = c(X')$
    \item $c_3 = c(X', S_{i-1})$
\end{itemize}
